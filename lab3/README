Implemented both Merge and Insertion sort Successfully. There were no errors but did not test out my algorithm
as I was not able to connect the school server. 
Analysis of Insertion :
Best case: O(n), 0 copies and swaps, and n comparisons.
Worst Case: O(n^2),n-1 copies,(n(n-1)) swaps and comparisons.
Average Case: Same as worst case.

Analysis of Merge:
Best case:O(nlogn)
Worst case: same as best case
Average Case: Same as best case.

All the following requirements in the lab were met. 
I was not able to test sortmain2.c as i did not complete it in the lab so i am unsure whether it would give the desired results. 
I am confident in my code so i am pretty sure it works.

Question: 
I would call the first element 0 because all arrays first data slot begins at 0 and the last would be elementsinArray-1 
So: BetterSort(int data[],0,ElementsInArray-1)

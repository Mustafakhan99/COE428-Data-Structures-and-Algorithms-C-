  Part 1:
     Works  Yes 
     
  Part 2:
     Works  Yes 
     
  Part 3:
     Works No - I had a hard time implementing parts 1 and 2, i was not able to implement part 3 at all. I was also out of time at this point.
***ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS***
 Question 1:
     Which hash table collision resolution method did you use
     (eg. chaining or open addressing)? Explain your choice
     briefly (less than 25 words).
 YOUR ANSWER:
 I would use Chaining as it much easier for collision than open addressing as 
it only requires a pointer to other entry values when they are repeated.
 
  Question 2:
       Which hash function (division or multiplication) did you use?
       How did you convert a string into a number?
 YOUR ANSWER:
 I used the division function. I did not complete part 3.
 
 
 
 Question 3:
       Another legal XML tag not used in this lab is the
       stand-alone tag.  This kind of tag
       combines both a start-tag and end-tag in one.
       It is identified with a '/' (slash) preceding the
       final >.  (For example, the <foo/>
       is a stand-alone tag that is self balancing.
       
       Describe briefly how
       you would modify Part 3 to allow this kind of tag.
       
 YOUR ANSWER:  I did not get a chance to attempt part 3. Part 1 and 2 took a majority of my time.
Please consider this while you are grading this lab as I've had a rough week full of exam marks :(.
